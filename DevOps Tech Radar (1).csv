Bitnami Sealed Secrets,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"<p>We mentioned some of the emerging criticisms about <strong><a href=""https://www.langchain.com/"">LangChain</a></strong> in the previous Radar. Since then, we‚Äôve become even more wary of it. While the framework offers a powerful set of features for building applications with large language models (LLMs), we‚Äôve found it to be hard to use and overcomplicated. LangChain gained early popularity and attention in the space, which turned it into a default for many developers. However, as LangChain is trying to evolve and keep up with the fast pace of change, it has become harder and harder to navigate those changes of concepts and patterns as a developer. We‚Äôve also found the API design to be inconsistent and verbose. As such, it often obscures what is actually going on under the hood, making it hard for developers to understand and control how LLMs and the various patterns around them actually work. We‚Äôre moving LangChain to the Hold ring to reflect this. In many of our use cases, we‚Äôve found that an implementation with minimum use of specialized frameworks is sufficient. Depending on your use case, you may also want to consider other frameworks such as <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/semantic-kernel"">Semantic Kernel</a>, <a href=""https://haystack.deepset.ai/"">Haystack</a> or <a href=""/radar/tools/litellm"">LiteLLM</a>.</p>"
